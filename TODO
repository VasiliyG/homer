make the program use M114 to get current position before and after printing a file
or consider using M114 to keep track of machine position (instead of software stored)

at least use M114 to grab machine coordinates after homing

use a file to load dictionary of files and descriptions for files menu

make tool changes use ptr.waitOk() and investigate weird behavior on first toolchange

change stored positions to an empty dictionary, so you can use any key for storage

make increment persistent in save file
